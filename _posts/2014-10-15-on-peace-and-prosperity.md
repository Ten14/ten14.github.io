> in this way prosperity will come to you.  
> -Job 22:21 NIV

The ancient Hebrews &#8211; the people who wrote the Old Testament &#8211; believed that wealth was a reward for righteousness and poverty a punishment for sin.

We should know better by now.

We have all seen immoral rich people and poverty-stricken saints. We know that money comes to people through all sorts of ways and means, some above reproach, and some beyond the pale.

We have all seen good and righteous people, hard working people, who just couldn&rsquo;t get a break financially, or who were simply not that good at life management skills. (Remember &#8211; the ability to balance a checkbook or understand how compound interest works is not a moral issue.)

So what are we to make of a statement like the one above? How do we understand that promises like these are kept faithfully by God without falling into some kind of New Age &ldquo;Prosperity Gospel&rdquo; or old timey puritanical judgement?

To begin with, we need to realize that the wealth of the immoral is not prosperity. No matter how much it looks and sounds like prosperity, immoral wealth is a cancer, a disease. And the primary victim of immoral wealth is the immorally wealthy person.

The next thing to understand is that not all moral people &#8211; not all good people &#8211; have truly submitted to God and are at peace with Him.

I used to sell insurance. I was not bad at selling &#8211; sometimes I was even mildly brilliant. I was willing to work hard. And I was fully committed to being upright and moral in all of my dealings. I never exaggerated or over sold, I never lied or cheated.

And yet &#8211; I didn&rsquo;t do all that well.

I did okay, sure. I paid my bills &#8211; most of the time. But I was far, far away from any meaningful notion of &ldquo;prosperity&rdquo; in relation to my insurance business.

Why is that?

Because it was not the path that God wanted me to follow.

There was nothing wrong with it. There is nothing inherently immoral about insurance sales or financial services. I realized in the few years I worked at that business that there was certainly a strong need for the type of service I was offering.

But it wasn&rsquo;t for me.

God had other plans for me.

Not better plans. Not higher plans. It&rsquo;s not as if some schmucks have to sell insurance while God has greater things destined for me.

It is simply that some people are called to one thing, and others are called to another.

Doing work &#8211; even decent, good work &#8211; that is not the work God intends for you is a form of rebellion. It is the opposite of submission. It is a form of rebellion which is perhaps much more mild than other forms. It&rsquo;s not as bad as blasphemy or heresy or some kind of mortal sin. But it is still living out-of-harmony with God&rsquo;s purpose.

It usually occurs not when we reject God&rsquo;s plan for us, but when we forget to ask and seek to know.

When we find the work the God intends for us, when we discover through prayer and study, the purpose that God has placed before us, we will prosper in that work, and in our lives.
