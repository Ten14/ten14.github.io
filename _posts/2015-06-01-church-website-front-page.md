title: What to put on the front page of your church website
summary: Give the people what they want
---

Over the last few years I have visited a lot of churches. Last time I counted, it was over 40, in 5 states, in the last six years or so.

Since moving to Berkeley (so that my wife, and eventually I, could attend CDSP), I have visited over 20 parishes.

And I have looked at the websites of every single one of them.

Not in my usual professional capacity as web developer and technologist, with a critical eye about what needed to be improved or concerns about abstract usability principles. 

I was looking at websites of churches the way most people do --- trying to get enough information to:

 - help me get there on Sunday morning at the right time
 - know what to expect when I got there
 - decide whether to go to one church or another
 - figure out if this was a church we wanted to join as a family

I discovered that many church websites did not help me find the information I was looking for.

## Help me pick you

As a visitor to a new church, I want to like it. When I was in "church shopping" mode, I _really_ wanted to find a church. 

Most newcomers are going to see your website first. Help them like you. Help them pick you.

Or, if they wouldn't in a million years want to go to church with you, help them figure that out, too.

Give them the information they need, right up front.

### Service Times

This should be the most basic thing. Everyone knows this, yes?

Your weekend service schedule needs to be on the front page of your website, above the fold, and easy to find.

If you have other worship services during the week, you can put them there also, or on a separate page with a link from the home page.

You do not need to put your entire weekly schedule (book club, choir practice, adult bible study, AA) there. Have a calendar page (with a link in your primary navigation).

Service times need to be easy to find. They need to be so easy to find that a parent who is wrangling their child into church clothes after sleeping too late on Sunday can double-check if the second service starts at 10:15 or 10:30 while simultaneously informing the child which shoes go on which feet.

It is not required, but it also nice if your weekend services have honest, descriptive names.

### Your Address (In text)

Not a picture of your address. Not your mailing address. Not a description or driving directions.

And, by the way, all of it. City and zip code.

Do you know how normal people get directions now? They ask their phone, car, or Google how to get there. To that they need to be able to:

 - read your address (all of it)
 - copy and paste (not everyone does this, but some of us do)

If you want to also make the address text a link to Google Maps, that would be awesome. But _at least_ make it copyable.

### Attractive, but honest, pictures of your worship services

Pictures of Bible study is nice, pictures of youth group are great, pictures of your last picnic are lovely.

But what I really want to know is --- what am I getting myself into if I go there on a Sunday morning?

Do you have a vested choir? A praise team? A bluegrass band? Are you crowded or relatively empty? Will there be incense? Dancing? Kneeling? Arm waving?

### Links to social media

At the very least, you should have a Facebook page, and you should link to it from your website's front page.

After Facebook, the next most important site is probably Instagram --- with more pictures of parish life. YouTube, with videos of sermons and services (among other things) is also really good.

### Very clear navigation 

There's only a handful of other pieces of information people typically need or want from your website. Organize it into a small handful of top-level menu items with drop-down items.

### Your denominational affiliation or tradition

I have been in meetings where I was told to make the words "Episcopal Church" much bigger, so I understand that this can be taken way too far.

You don't need to _convince_ people that you really, super-duper, actually are a part of the institution you claim to be a part of (unless you do), but it is a good idea to simply let people know.

For some parishes, this is easy --- it's part of the name. Our Lady of Perpetual Tithing Roman Catholic Church doesn't need additional text describing what communion they belong to.

But St. John the Baptist Lutheran Church might confuse people. A small "Evangelical Lutheran Church in America" (or whichever) subheading would be more than enough to inform all the people who need to know.

Because of the issue with the name "Episcopal Church" in some areas, incorporating the official shield logo of TEC (according to their usage style guide) probably communicates everything that it needs to. Other communities in similar situations can probably find equally elegant solutions.

## Other things you _might_ want to put on the front page

Those things above are the essentials. But there are other things that can be nice:

 - A short (one sentence) statement of welcome.
 - A short (one sentence) description of your church community.
 - A way to subscribe to updates (via your email list)
 - A way to search for content
 - Major announcements (which _must not_ be past their expiration date)
 - Latest news from your blog (only if there's content less than a month old)
 - Latest Tweets/Facebookings/Whatevers (less than a few days old)

### But don't forget

If you add other things, make sure that you do not obscure those items or make them hard to find. Remember --- I need to be able to find what I'm looking for while also helping my kid get dressed for church.
