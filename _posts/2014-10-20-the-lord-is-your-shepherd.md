> The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.  
> -Psalm 23:1 KJV

When we do not have the money and resources we feel we need or want, we can often feel as if we are lacking something. We feel insecure if we can&rsquo;t pay the bills. We feel like failures if we try to get rich and do not succeed.

But God is with us, guiding us and protecting us. We do not NEED money or wealth. Those are fine things to have and to pursue, until their possession or their pursuit makes us forget on whom we truly rely.

No matter how rich and powerful you are or become, no matter how poor and desperate you may be or feel &#8211; you are a sheep in the flock of the Lord.

The Lord is YOUR shepherd. You lack nothing.
