God is absolute abundance. God needs nothing from us.

The Bible &#8211; particularly the Old Testament &#8211; spends a lot of energy making sure that we all know that God is in charge. God owns all things. We are merely tenants, stewards, and servants of His majesty and grace.

It is easy to look at the world and notice its flaws and then want to fix them. Often, people who are wealthy (or on their way to becoming wealthy) think that they need to expend their resources in order to FIX things. In essence, they behave &#8211; and somethings think &#8211; as if they believe that God needs their help.

God does not need your help.

Your fellow human beings need your help. Your neighbors, your friends, your family need your help. Strangers need your help. Your enemies need your help.

And actually &#8211; perhaps &ldquo;help&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t the right wordâ€¦

They need your love.

And you need to love them.

That is what we were made for &#8211; to love each other.

The world is only a terrible place because of what people have done to it, and to each other. And people have done these things because they have not known the love of God in Christ Jesus. Even many people who call themselves Christians have not known the love of God in Christ Jesus.

If you were a billionaire, you might think it a good idea to do some humanitarian work- let&rsquo;s say (just for example) build a well in some poor village some place.

This is a perfectly reasonable thing to do, and the people in that village (assuming they felt they needed a well) would probably be very grateful.

But if all you are doing is &ldquo;sending money&rdquo; or spending resources, very little is really accomplished. Wells run dry, and people live and die whether they have running water at hand or whether they have to walk a mile to fetch it.

I am NOT saying it is better not to give the money.

But better still than giving the money is loving the people. Better is to enter into relationship with them.

Most of us will never be billionaires, or be burdened with the decisions that go along with deciding how to spend that kind of money wisely.

But whether we are millionaires, or thousandaires, or hundredaires &#8211; if we have resources which other people do not have access to, we are richer than they are. And scripture is quite clear that the rich are tasked with caring for the poor.

But God &#8211; ultimately &#8211; has care of all the people of the world, and God does not need your money.

What God desires &#8211; as best I can tell from all my reading of scripture &#8211; is that we love each other deeply.

Out of that love will flow an abundance of gifts and works. We may build wells or houses, fill pantries and volunteer at soup kitchens. We might start businesses that bring jobs and resources into poor communities. We might lend capital, we might mentor children.

But we must do these things out of an understanding that we are not solving God&rsquo;s problems. We are, rather, participating in God&rsquo;s love.
