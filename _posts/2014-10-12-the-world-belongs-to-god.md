This one fact, that all things belong to the Lord &#8211; to God &#8211; is the most important thing that we must learn about our money. It must become the central point of understanding when we think about wealth and success.

God possesses all things. God owns all things.

Your money?

Your house?

Your car?

All of it belongs to the Lord. And God can (and often does) do with it as He pleases, for reasons which we humans will often find puzzling, confusing, or just downright mysterious.

Once we give ourselves over to the fact that God owns all our stuff, that none of it is really ours, we can let go of our fear, of our anxiety at not having enough, at not possessing enough.

[And we can embrace the fact that whatever we do have was entrusted to us by God for some use and purpose.][2]<img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=musforsun-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0310205719" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />

And whatever that purpose is &#8211; whatever it is that you are called to do in your life &#8211; surely God will provide whatever you need in order to fulfil that purpose. Including money, if that&rsquo;s what it take.
