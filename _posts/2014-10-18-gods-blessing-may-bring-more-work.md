At first glance, this seems to be simply a message about the rewards of following God&rsquo;s law. If you keep God&rsquo;s commands, he will reward you with abundance.

That&rsquo;s trueâ€¦ sort of.

But what, according to the passage is God rewarding the faithful with?

Rain.

And good soil.

God is promising to provide that which only God can provide: good weather, good dirt, good plants.

There is still work to be done.

We&rsquo;ve ALREADY followed God&rsquo;s laws. We&rsquo;ve ALREADY been living a moral and righteous life. God has blessed us and rewarded us. But with what? Not the things we want and need, but with the opportunity to achieve them.

It is still up to the people to do the threshing and the vinting, and the sowing and the harvesting.

Whatever rewards God has in store for you, it may be that those rewards spur you on to more work, to the opportunity to prosper.
