Job is my favorite book of the Old Testament, and my second favorite book of the whole Bible (after the Gospel of John).

I like it for a lot of reasons, not all of which I can even put words to.

But one thing I think I like about it, as someone who writes and thinks about financial matters, is that it both supports and demolishes the notion of the &ldquo;Prosperity Gospel.&rdquo;

On the one hand, Job is wealthy and prosperous, and also righteous. The argument of Satan in the heavenly court is that Job is only righteous because of his prosperity and wealth.

In bringing suffering and pain upon Job, Satan&rsquo;s argument is proven completely wrong. Job&rsquo;s righteousness and his prosperity have nothing to do with each other. He remains faithful, he remains righteous.

Even in the midst of not only his own suffering, but his own anger, his own confusion.

Righteousness and faithfulness, in Job, do not require him to stop seeking after the truths of God. They do not require him to play the victim or to set aside his confusion and despair.

And, if you have read Job, you know that he is ultimately rewarded for his faithfulness. His health and his wealth are restored.

In your times of trouble, in your despair and distress, remember the lessons of Job. You need not feel guilty about your confusion, you need not stop seeking for answers to your questions &#8211; although you might do well to realize that not all of your questions will be answered in this life.

When ruin and misfortune pile up on you, do not play the victim or turn away from God in despair. Rather, embrace God&rsquo;s work in your life, and bless God&rsquo;s Holy Name.
