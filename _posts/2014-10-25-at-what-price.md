> -Proverbs 21:6 NIV

We should all be willing to pay the price needed in order to achieve our goals. But we should not be willing to pay ANY price.

Getting rich is fine, if it is God&rsquo;s will for your life. But pursuing wealth through immoral means &#8211; through lying or cheating &#8211; will lead to your ruination.

We have all seen plenty of examples of this. Rich executives or Ponzi schemers escorted out of their offices in handcuffs.

But that is not the only kind of ruination there is.

In fact, the ones who get caught in their own lifetime &#8211; those are the lucky ones. The ruination of their fortunes and personal lives gives them the opportunity to reflect on the ruination of their souls, and &#8211; perhaps &#8211; they are able to repent and seek forgiveness from God and from those they have plundered.

We all know that many, many people who have gotten their wealth through immoral means go unpunished and unashamed. We see them and are tempted to think, &ldquo;IT could work out for me. Look &#8211; that guy won&rsquo;t ever get caught.&rdquo;

But the ruination of his soul is his punishment. His immoral wealth is a poison, no matter how healthy his life looks.

Do not be fooled.

Strive, as best you can, for the wealth and prosperity that God is calling you to. That may be a little, or it may be a lot. But whether it is great or small, it has been prepared for you by God, and it is yours if you work for it honestly and under His guidance.

To do otherwise, to seek after wealth that is not intended for you, to strive against God&rsquo;s law through lying and fraud &#8211; these things are death and ruin.
