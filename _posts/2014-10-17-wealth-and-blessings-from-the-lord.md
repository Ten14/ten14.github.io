> The blessing of the Lord brings wealth,  
> without painful toil for it.  
> -Proverbs 10:22 NIV

There are at least two different ways to look at this verse, and both are equally true. And not just that &#8211; the two different ways of looking at it are actually the same.

The first way is the obvious one: that material wealth and riches come as blessing from God, and that we need not toil in pain in order to achieve those blessings.

The second way of look at it is that the blessings of God, in and of themselves, are riches (spiritually speaking) and that those blessings are given to us freely, as Grace.

When and if wealth comes to you, it is most certainly a blessing from God.

This is not to suggest AT ALL that one must not work for money. We all know that it is near impossible to get rich while being lazy, and the Bible itself is full of advice about working hard and toiling.

But we need to remember that even in that &#8211; even money which we have clearly earned through hard work and enterprise &#8211; even that money is a part of God&rsquo;s grace and blessings.

There is no reason &#8211; apart from God &#8211; that we should have the skills needed to work and earn. There is no fundamental law of the universe &#8211; apart from God&rsquo;s will &#8211; that human beings should need each other so much that civilization should arise and bring with it both the need for money and the means for acquiring it.

And so all of our material wealth, our prosperity if we have any, has its source &#8211; as do all things &#8211; in God, and no toil or suffering of ours has really anything to do with its existence.

Moreover &#8211; money, and financial wealth generally &#8211; is just ONE of the infinite aspects of God&rsquo;s blessings. Money is one way that some of us our wealthy. It is not the only way. God&rsquo;s blessings make each and everyone of us rich &#8211; even though not all of us have a lot of money.

When we recognize this fact &#8211; that wealth is found in God&rsquo;s blessings &#8211; we are free to worry less about our financial wealth. And this allows us to become as rich &#8211; in money, and in blessings &#8211; as God desires us to be.
