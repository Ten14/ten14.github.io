When you hear about strategies that claim to legally allow US citizens to avoid having to pay income tax, the first thing that probably comes to mind is that it&rsquo;s some sort of cockamamie scheme.



The US government is no slouch when it comes to shaking down its citizens for every penny. It would be foolish in the extreme to think you could slip one past them.

There really was no sure way to legally escape the suffocating grip of the US government besides death and renouncing your US citizenship… until recently.

A new option has emerged that allows Americans to significantly reduce or eliminate income tax altogether. At first it sounds impossible, but as Casey Research&rsquo;s Chief Metals and Mining Strategist Louis James has found out for himself, this is 100% real and legitimate.

And for many Americans, including individuals operating on a modest scale, it could really be game-changing.

The video below is a recent presentation Louis gave on this jaw-dropping opportunity.
