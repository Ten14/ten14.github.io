When people ask me what the most important thing is financially, I tell them: knowledge.

Information, skills, wisdom, and common sense.

If you are struggling to get by and you want to be comfortable, or if you are comfortable and want to become wealthy &#8211; you need knowledge that you do not currently have.

Some people are afraid this means college, and since they can&rsquo;t afford it &#8211; or don&rsquo;t have the time, or were bad students &#8211; they think they can never learn.

But learning isn&rsquo;t something that happens in schools only, or even in schools mostly.

Learning is what happens when people take responsibility for finding out what they need to know, and then figuring out how to know it.

Those old GI JOE commercials were right: Knowing is half the battle.

If you are struggling to get by, if you can&rsquo;t find any work for much more than minimum wage, how can you ever get over that hump?

By acquiring skills you do not currently have to make yourself more valuable. This could mean making yourself more employable, so that you can get a steady job, or figuring out ways to make money on your own.

Maybe you could learn more about computers and software applications so that you can get an office job as a secretary or administrative assistant. Maybe you could learn about Web design and development and make a little side cash as a freelancer.

Can&rsquo;t figure out what to do with that ridiculous English major? Have you tried blogging?

Good with your hands, but can&rsquo;t find work in construction or manufacturing? Have you thought about becoming a Licensed Massage Therapist or even a Chiropractor?

Some people have a vague and undefined collection of people skills- the kind of thing that doesn&rsquo;t look that great on a resume. Maybe you could learn how to do direct sales, and make money in anything from real estate to insurance to smelly candles.

And if you don&rsquo;t have any idea what to do, you could at least start reading about success. You could read about people who figured out how to earn a living, even though they didn&rsquo;t seem to have much going for them.

God has given you a brain, a capacity to learn and grow. Take advantage of that blessing. Learn something new. Become smarter, wiser, and (God willing) richer.
