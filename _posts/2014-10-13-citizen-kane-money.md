> -Ecclesiastes 4:6 NIV 

There&rsquo;s a fabulous line in the classic movie Citizen Kane: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no trick to make a lot of money, if all you want to do is make a lot of money.&rdquo;

As Christians &#8211; heck, as human beings &#8211; we should want to do more than simply &ldquo;make a lot of money.&rdquo;

Many famous entrepreneurs and successful people talk about changing the world, &ldquo;making a dent,&rdquo; or pursuing some passion or another.

These are all good and noble things, and you should do them if you feel called to do so.

But before that, commit yourself that you will live a life of peace. A life of tranquility.

This does not mean a life of leisure! And to say that you should commit to a life of peace does not mean that you should avoid difficulty, conflict, or discomfort.

A life of peace, a life of tranquility means a life that is not at odds with your own values, a life that is not in conflict with the Gospel that has been revealed to you.

If you are called to wealth, pursue it. If you are called to change the world, get up and do it. Be willing to pay the price, but not any price.
